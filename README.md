# Deep Learning for Computer Vision # 

This is a course offered by Technical University of Munich, Computer Vision Chair. I am sharing the last exercise of this class, which is the most interesting one. The exercises are similar to Stanford's Deep Learning course. 

Here, you can find the convolutional neural network implementation hardcoded by PyTorch. 
As well, there is an image segmentation network on top of VGG16.
